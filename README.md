# RightStrain
A marijuana recommender system built using user reviews of marijuana strains

Rightstrain was built using data scraped from various marijuana databases. Using an NLP approach to preprocess the data, 
then EDA with TF-IDF and an LDA, it turned out that the data was able to identify customer segments within the industry. 
Because the product is still being used today, full code is not available. This notebook walks through how one can use an NLP 
and LDA to understand text data.
